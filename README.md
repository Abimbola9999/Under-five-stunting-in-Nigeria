# Factors Associated With Stunting Among Under-Five Children in Nigeria

### Project Overview

Stunting, a major indicator of chronic malnutrition, remains a significant public health concern in Nigeria, affecting the growth, development, and long-term well-being of children. This study aims to examine the factors associated with stunting among under-five children in Nigeria using data from the Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS). The research explores the influence of maternal, household, and community-level determinants on childhood stunting. Through statistical analysis in Stata, key risk factors such as maternal education, socioeconomic status, healthcare access, and regional disparities are assessed. Findings from this study will provide evidence-based recommendations to inform policies and interventions aimed at reducing child malnutrition in Nigeria.
